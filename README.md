# Scientific papers abstract implementation 
This repository is intended for personal use, where I aim to implement general solutions based on newly published scientific papers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and, more broadly, Machine Learning (ML).
The repository's structure will consist of separate directories for each paper, containing the corresponding code and resources. On this page, I will provide a summary of each paper's approach and its mathematical aspects, linking it to its respective folder. The goal is to simplify the learning process for the paper's complexities and implement it in the most straightforward way. Additionally, I will include a link to the original paper and its citation.
The idea will be to implement Scholar recommended papers related to relation extraction:

[GeoSMIE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424032457)

A document-level event extraction framework for extracting Spatial Morphological Information (SMI) from geological texts. It treats SMI extraction as an event extraction task, filling predefined SMI record tables. The framework incorporates a no-trigger-word annotation strategy to handle cases where explicit morphological triggers are absent. Additionally, dual graph neural networks are employed to capture both local and global contextual dependencies within documents. By leveraging pre-trained RoBERTa for text representation and constructing heterogeneous graphs to model interactions, GeoSMIE effectively extracts descriptive and digital SMIs
